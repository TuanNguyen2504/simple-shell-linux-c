=========== Objectives ===========

-Learn Unix Shell.
-Learn Unix Parent and Child Processes.
-Learn Unix Input and Output redirections.
-Learn Unix Pipe.
-Learn Unix fork(), exec(), wait(), open(), close(), dup(), and pipe() system calls.
-Implement a Simple Shell Application using Unix system calls.

=========== Project Simple Shell ===========

This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process. Your implementation will support input and output redirection, as well as pipes as a form of IPC between a pair of commands. Completing this project will involve using the UNIX fork(), exec(), wait(), dup2(), and pipe() system calls and can be completed on Linux system.
